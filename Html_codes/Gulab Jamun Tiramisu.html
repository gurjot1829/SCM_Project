<h2>Gulab Jamun Tiramisu</h2>
<p>Chef Obi creates his spin on classic Italian tiramisu by layering gulab jamun, an Indian dessert that is starchy, sweet, and floral, with cardamom-infused tiragulla cream, cocoa powder, and finely crushed pistachios for crunch.

<li>½ cup granulated sugar(100 g)</li>
<li>¼ teaspoon vanilla essense</li>
<li>1 cup mascarpone(160 g)</li>
<li>2 cups espresso(480 mL)</li>
<li>2 oz coffee liqueur(55 mL)</li>
<p><b>GULAB JAMUN</p></b>
<li>2 cups granulated sugar(400 g)</li>
<li>2 teaspoons ground cardamom</li>
<li>2 cups water(480 mL)</li>
<li>1 teaspoon rose water</li>
<li>1 cup milk powder(125 g)</li>
<li>¼ cup all purpose flour(60 mL), plus more as needed</li>
<li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
<li>3 teaspoons ghee</li>
<li>3 tablespoons yogurt, plus more as needed</li>
<li>4 qt neutral oil(4 L), for frying</li>
<p><b>ASSEMBLY</p></b>
<li>unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
<li>pistachio, finely crushed</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Preparation</b></p>
<ol>
<li>Make the tirragulla: In a large bowl, use an electric mixer on medium speed to beat the heavy cream and cardamom until stiff peaks form, about 2 minutes.</li>
<li>Fill a large pot with a couple inches of water and bring to a simmer. Set a separate large heatproof bowl on top, making sure the water is not touching the bottom of the bowl, and add the egg yolks, sugar, and vanilla. Cook, whisking constantly, until thickened and pale, about 6 minutes. Remove the bowl from the pot.</li>
<li>In a separate large bowl, whisk the mascarpone until fluffy, 2–3 minutes. Add the egg mixture to the mascarpone and use a rubber spatula to gently fold until incorporated.</li>
<li>Add the mascarpone mixture to the whipped cream and fold until smooth. Transfer the mixture to a large piping bag and refrigerate until ready to use.</li>
<li>In a medium bowl, stir together the espresso and coffee liqueur. Cover and refrigerate until ready to use.</li>
<li>Make the gulab jamun: In a small saucepan over medium heat, combine the sugar, cardamom, and water. Bring to a boil and cook until thickened, about 7 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in the rose water. Cover and set aside while you make the dough.</li>
<li>In a medium bowl, stir together the milk powder, flour, baking soda, ghee, and yogurt until a ball of dough forms, using your hands to bring together. If the dough feels too dry, add a bit more yogurt. If the dough feels too sticky, add a little bit more flour.</li>
<li>Divide the dough evenly into 12 small balls, being careful not to press the dough or knead it (it is helpful to lightly oil your hands when working with the dough).</li>
<li>Heat the oil in a large, heavy-bottomed pot over medium heat until the temperature reaches 350°F (180°C). Set a wire rack over a baking sheet.</li>
<li>Working in batches to avoid overcrowding the pot, fry the dough balls in the hot oil until they are golden brown and float to the surface, about 3 minutes. Transfer to the wire rack to drain.</li>
<li>Add the gulab jamun to the syrup and toss to coat. Let the gulab jamun rest in the syrup for at least 2 hours, or up to overnight, then remove from the syrup and set on a baking sheet until ready to use.</li>
<li>Assemble the tiramisu: Slice the gulab jamun in half and dip in the espresso mixture, then remove and squeeze out some of the excess liquid. Return to the baking sheet and let sit for 1 hour at room temperature.</li>
<li>Pipe some of the tirragulla into a large martini glass and top with some of the soaked galub jamun. Use a small sifter to dust the top with the cocoa powder. Repeat to make another layer and finish with a final layer of tiragulla. Dust the top with cocoa powder and finely crushed pistachios. Repeat with the remaining martini glasses.</li>
<li>Refrigerate for a few hours before serving.</li>
<li>Enjoy!</li>
