<h2>Asian Sticky Ribs</h2>
<p>This was one of my mom’s bi-weekly dinners in rotation when I was growing up and it satisfies every flavor profile you could ask for. Sticky and sweet, savory and meaty, AND it’s a super hands-off recipe. Serve with a pot of fresh rice and blanched veggies and enjoy!

<p><b>Ingredients for</b><br>4 servings<p>
<ul>
<li>2 ½ lb pork ribs(2.2 kg)</li>
<li>1 tablespoon kosher salt</li>
<li>3 tablespoons sugar, divided</li>
<li>1 tablespoon garlic powder</li>
<li>1 ½ teaspoons freshly ground black pepper</li>
<li>3 green onions, whites and green parts separated, plus more for garnish</li>
<li>1 tablespoon neutral oil</li>
<li>1 shallot, minced</li>
<li>1 red jalapeño, sliced, divided, plus more for garnish</li>
<li>6 garlic cloves, minced</li>
<li>2 tablespoons grated lemongrass</li>
<li>2 tablespoons nước màu, or 1 tablespoon dark soy sauce</li>
<li>1 ½ tablespoons fish sauce</li>
<li>2 cups water(480 mL), or as needed</li>
<li>1 tablespoon sesame seeds, for garnish</li>

<p><b>Preparation</b></p>
<ol>
<li>Add the pork ribs to a large bowl and season with the salt, 1½ teaspoons sugar, the garlic powder, and black pepper.</li>
<li>Slice the white parts of the green onions lengthwise and chop the green parts; set the greens aside.</li>
<li>Heat the oil in a large pan over medium heat. Add the shallot, half of the jalapeño, white parts of the green onions, and garlic and sauté until light golden, 3 minutes.</li>
<li>Add the ribs to the aromatics and brown on all sides, about 4 minutes, then add the grated lemongrass, remaining 2½ tablespoons of sugar, the nước màu, fish sauce, enough water to come about halfway up the ribs, the rest of the jalapeño, and the scallion greens. Cover and simmer for 20 minutes, or until the liquid has reduced by half and the ribs are caramelized.</li>
<li>Garnish with sesame seeds and more jalapeño and scallions and serve over rice.</li>
