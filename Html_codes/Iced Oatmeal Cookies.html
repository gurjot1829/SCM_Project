<li>Pulse oats in a food processor or blender 10 times.</li>
<li>Add pulsed oats, flour, baking powder, cinnamon, and nutmeg into a bowl.</li>
<li>In a large bowl, beat softened butter with a hand mixer until creamy, add brown and white sugars, then beat until fluffy. Next beat in vanilla and eggs 1 at a time.</li>
<li>Pour the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients ⅓ at a time until it’s gone and dough forms.</li>
<li>Fold in raisins or chocolate chunks.</li>
<li>Take 1 tablespoon of dough and roll it into a ball. Then flatten into a cookie shape and put on a well-greased parchment-lined baking sheet.</li>
<li>Bake 12-15 minutes. (Top rack = no brown bottoms, bottom rack = browned bottoms and a little more crispy).</li>
<li>Cool completely and make the icing in the meantime. Combine powdered sugar, milk, and warm water in a shallow bowl. Once the cookies have cooled, dip into the icing or dab icing on with a pastry brush. Dry for 10 minutes or until icing has hardened.</li>
