<h2>Garlic knots</h2>
<p>Do NOT sleep on these delicious garlic knots. Warm and tender, they make the perfect appetizer or side dish for any pizza or pasta night. First, make an easy dough and let it rest while you prep the rest of dinner. Portion the dough and roll into knots, bake to golden brown perfection, then douse in garlic butter and finish in the oven (trust us when we say your kitchen is going to smell amazing). Definitely double up the recipe if you’re feeding a crowd—and don’t forget the marinara sauce for dipping!
