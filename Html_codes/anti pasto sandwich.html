<li>3 ¾ cups all-purpose flour(465 g), plus 2 tablespoons</li>
<li>2 ½ teaspoons kosher salt</li>
<li>½ cup olive oil(120 mL), divided</li>
<li>1 tablespoon McCormick® Perfect Pinch® Italian Seasoning</li>
<li>flaky sea salt, for garnish</li>
<p><b>For Assembly</p></b>
<li>1 cup mayonnaise(240 mL)</li>
<li>1 tablespoon McCormick® Perfect Pinch® Italian Seasoning</li>
<li>Sliced turkey</li>
<li>Sliced spicy salami</li>
<li>sliced prosciutto</li>

</ul>
<p><b>Preparation</b></p>
<ol>
<li>In a liquid measuring cup, whisk together the water, sugar, and yeast. Let sit for 5 minutes, until foamy.</li>
<li>In a large bowl, mix together the flour and kosher salt. Pour in the yeast mixture and mix with a wooden spoon until a shaggy, wet dough forms.</li>
<li>Add ¼ cup of the olive oil to a separate large bowl, rubbing with your fingers to coat the inside evenly. Transfer the dough to the oiled bowl, flipping the dough to coat with oil all over. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight, or let rest at room temperature for 5 hours, until doubled in size.</li>
<li>Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C).</li>
<li>Coat a 9 x 13-inch baking dish with the remaining ¼ cup olive oil. Turn the proofed dough onto the baking pan and press with your fingertips to stretch all the way to the edges of the pan. Sprinkle the dough with the Perfect Pinch® Italian Seasoning.</li>
<li>Bake the focaccia for 30–35 minutes, or until golden brown on top. Remove from the oven, sprinkle with flaky salt, and allow to cool for 30 minutes.</li>
<li>Assemble the sandwiches: Cut the slab of focaccia into 6 squares, then slice each square in half horizontally to open.</li>
<li>In a small bowl, mix together the mayonnaise and McCormick® Perfect Pinch® Italian Seasoning.</li>
<li>Spread the seasoned mayonnaise on both sides of each piece of focaccia. Top one side of each sandwich with turkey, spicy salami, prosciutto, mozzarella, roasted red bell peppers, arugula, and a drizzle of balsamic glaze, then close the sandwiches with the remaining focaccia. Slice in half diagonally and serve.</li>
<li>Enjoy!</li>
