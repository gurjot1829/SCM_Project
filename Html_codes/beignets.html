</p><br>
<p><b>Ingredients for</b><br>30 beignets<p>
<ul>
<li>¾ cup lukewarm water(180 mL)</li>
<li>3 ½ teaspoons active dry yeast</li>
<li>2 large eggs</li>
<li>½ cup whole milk(120 mL)</li>
<li>3 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted</li>
<li>¼ cup granulated sugar(50 g), plus 2 tablespoons</li>
<li>4 cups bread flour(500 g), plus more for dusting</li>
<li>½ teaspoon kosher salt</li>
<li>8 cups canola oil(1.9 L), for frying, plus more for greasing</li>
<li>powdered sugar, for topping</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Preparation</b></p>
<ol>
<li>Pour the water into a medium bowl or large liquid measuring cup and sprinkle the yeast over the top. Let stand for about 5 minutes, until foamy.</li>
<li>Add the eggs, milk, melted butter, and sugar, and whisk to combine.</li>
<li>In a large bowl, whisk together the flour and salt.</li>
<li>Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients, stirring with a flexible spatula to form a shaggy dough. Turn the dough out onto a clean surface and use your hands to knead until it comes together in a smooth ball, about 2 minutes.</li>
<li>Grease a clean large bowl with canola oil. Transfer the dough to the greased bowl and cover tightly with plastic wrap. Let the dough rise in a warm place until doubled in size, about 1 hour.</li>
<li>Punch the dough down with your fist, then turn it out onto a lightly floured surface.</li>
<li>Roll the dough into a large rectangle, about ¼ inch (6 mm) thick. With a sharp knife, cut the dough into 2-inch (5 cm) squares, then transfer the squares to a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.</li>
<li>Heat the canola oil in a large pot over medium-high heat until it reaches 350˚F (180˚C).</li>
<li>Lower the dough squares, 3-4 at a time, into the hot oil. As soon as the beignets puff up, use tongs or a kitchen spider to gently flip them over. Fry until golden brown on both sides, flipping as needed, 2-3 minutes more. Transfer the beignets to a wire rack to drain.</li>
<li>Dust the beignets with powdered sugar and serve warm.</li>
<li>Enjoy!</li>
