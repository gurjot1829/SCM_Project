</p><br>
<p><b>Ingredients for</b><br>6 servings<p>
<ul>
<li>1 lb medium tomatillo(455 g), husks removed</li>
<li>½ medium white onion, halved</li>
<li>1 serrano pepper, stemmed</li>
<li>3 cloves garlic</li>
<li>water, as needed</li>
<li>½ bunch fresh cilantro, leaves and soft stems roughly chopped, plus more leaves for garnish - about 1 cup (40 G)</li>
<li>1 tablespoon kosher salt</li>
<li>½ cup low sodium chicken stock(120 mL)</li>
<li>¼ cup vegetable oil(60 mL), divided</li>
<li>12 thick slices corn tortilla</li>
<li>3 cups shredded rotisserie chicken(375 g)</li>
<li>5 oz queso fresco(150 g), crumbled</li>
<li>¼ medium white onion, finely chopped, for garnish</li>
<li>2 tablespoons mexican crema, for garnish</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Preparation</b></p>
<ol>
<li>Add the tomatillos, onion, serrano peppers, and garlic to a medium saucepan. Pour in enough water to just cover. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat and cook until the vegetables are very tender and the tomatillos have changed color, 8–10 minutes.</li>
<li>Use a slotted spoon to transfer the cooked vegetables to a blender and discard the cooking liquid. Purée the vegetables until broken down. Add the chopped cilantro, salt, and chicken stock. Blend the salsa until smooth. It should be speckled and thick.</li>
<li>Heat 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil in a large pan over medium-high heat. When the oil is shimmering, add the salsa verde to the pan. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to maintain a strong simmer. Cook until the salsa deepens in color and thickens slightly, about 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. Pour the salsa into a medium bowl and set aside. Wipe out the pan with a paper towel.</li>
<li>Heat the remaining 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil in the same pan over medium-high heat. Working 2 at a time, fry the tortillas for 1 minute per side, until starting to brown but not completely fried. They should be crisp around the edges but still pliable enough to roll. Transfer the tortillas to a paper towel-lined baking sheet to drain.</li>
<li>Set a rack in the center of the oven and turn on the broiler.</li>
<li>Spread ½ cup of the salsa verde over the bottom of a 9 x 13-inch (22 x 33 cm) baking dish.</li>
<li>Assemble the enchiladas: Dip a tortilla in the remaining salsa verde so both sides are coated. Place the tortilla on a flat surface and add about 4 tablespoons of shredded chicken to the center. Roll tightly. Place the filled tortilla, seam-side down, in the baking dish. Repeat with the remaining ingredients.</li>
<li>Pour any remaining salsa over the top of the enchiladas, then sprinkle with the queso fresco.</li>
<li>Broil the enchiladas until the cheese is just melted, 2–4 minutes.</li>
<li>Serve the enchiladas warm with the diced onion, Mexican crema, and cilantro leaves for topping</li>
<li>Enjoy!</li>
