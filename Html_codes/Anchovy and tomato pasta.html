<li>Melt the butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add 4 of the chopped anchovy filets and cook for 1 minute, until they begin to melt.</li>

<li>Heat ¼ cup (60 ml) of olive oil in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat. Once the oil begins to shimmer, add the remaining 6 anchovies and cook for 2 minutes, stirring frequently, until the anchovies begin to melt into the oil.</li>
<li>Add the garlic and red pepper flakes and cook for 30 seconds, until fragrant.</li>
<li>Add the tomatoes and stir to coat in the oil. Season with 1 teaspoon of salt and cook for 5 minutes, or until the tomatoes just begin to soften.</li>
<li>Add the white wine and reduce the heat to low. Cook for 5 minutes, or until the sauce is reduced by half.</li>
