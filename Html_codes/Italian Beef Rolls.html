<h2>Italian Beef Rolls</h2>
<p>Although these don’t taste exactly like Chicago-style Italian beef, the recipe sure is a fun way to make a delicious cheese- and beef-filled roll using simple ingredients.
</p><br>
<p><b>Ingredients for</b><br>8 servings<p>
<p><b>ITALIAN BEEF</p></b>
<ul>
<li>1 ½ lb beef chuck roast(650 g)</li>
<li>1 ½ teaspoons kosher salt</li>
<li>1 ½ teaspoons freshly ground black pepper</li>
<li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
<li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
<li>1 medium yellow onion, thiny sliced</li>
<li>½ cup pickled pepperoncini peppers(75 g)</li>
<li>3 cloves garlic, thinly sliced</li>
<li>1 tablespoon tomato paste</li>
<li>1 tablespoon dried oregano</li>
<li>1 ½ cups beef broth(360 mL)</li>
<p><b>ROLLS</p></b>
<li>1 tablespoon water, plus more for boiling</li>
<li>⅓ cup baking soda(40 g)</li>
<li>1 lb pizza dough(425 g)</li>
<li>8 slices provolone cheese, quartered, plus 2–4, cut into ½-inch strips, divided</li>
<li>1 large egg</li>
<li>garlic powder, for sprinkling</li>
<li>1 cup giardiniera(150 g), or other Italian pickled vegetables</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Preparation</b></p>
<ol>
<li>Make the Italian beef: Season the beef with the salt, pepper, and garlic powder.</li>
<liSet the Instant Pot to Sauté, then add the olive oil and heat until shimmering. Add the beef to the Instant Pot and sear until golden brown, about 4 minutes per side. Remove the beef from the pot and set aside.li>
<li>Add the onion to the Instant Pot and sauté until tender, about 3 minutes. Add the pepperoncinis, garlic, tomato paste, and oregano and stir to combine for about 2 minutes, then stir in the beef broth.</li>
<li>Return the beef to the Instant Pot, making sure it is covered by some of the broth and onions. Secure the lid, making sure the steam valve is set to Sealing. Set to Pressure Cook on High for 1 hour. When the cooking time is up, let the pressure release naturally, about 15 minutes.</li>
<li>Uncover the Instant Pot and transfer the beef to a cutting board, leaving the cooking liquid behind in the pot. Set the Instant Pot to Sauté and simmer the cooking liquid until reduced, about 8 minutes.</li>
<li>Meanwhile, shred the beef with two forks.</li>
<li>Make the rolls: Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
<li>Fill a medium pot a little over halfway with water and the baking soda. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat.</li>
<li>Divide the pizza dough into 8 portions, then roll each out to a ¼–½-inch-thick circle. Fill each round with 4 quarter-slices of Provolone cheese and some of the shredded beef. Gather the dough around the meat and cheese, pinching the seams to seal, and roll into smooth balls.</li>
<li>Working in batches, boil the rolls until the outside is slightly cooked, 45–60 seconds. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate to drain, then transfer to the prepared baking sheet</li>
<li>In a small bowl, whisk together the egg and 1 tablespoon of water.</li>
<li>Brush the rolls with the egg wash and sprinkle the tops with garlic powder. Place 2 Provolone strips on top of each roll to create an “X” shape.</li>
<li>Bake the rolls for 20 minutes, or until golden brown. Remove from the oven and let cool for about 10 minutes.</li>
<li>Serve the rolls warm with the reduced braising liquid and chopped giardiniera.</li>
<li>Enjoy!</li>
