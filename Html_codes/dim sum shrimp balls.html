<h2>Dim Sum Shrimp Balls</h2>
<p>You can find several different variations on crispy shrimp balls at dim sum restaurants, but this is Sarah's favorite kind, with shredded wonton wrappers for that added crunch and a nice, juicy shrimp filling that pairs perfectly with sweet chili dipping sauce. It’s a match made in heaven!

<p><b>Ingredients for</b><br>2 servings<p>
<ul>
<li>12 oz wonton wrappers(345 g)</li>

<p><b>Preparation</b></p>
<ol>
<li>Finely chop the shrimp, then add to a large bowl with the green onions, soy sauce, fish sauce, salt, pepper, and sugar. Mix well. Add the egg and rice flour and stir; the mixture should thicken a bit.</li>
<li>Use a sharp knife to shred the wonton wrappers into ½-inch-wide strips, then transfer to a separate large bowl.</li>
<li>Scoop 2 tablespoons of the shrimp filling into the bowl with the shredded wrappers and pat firmly to cover the filling completely. Repeat to make about 6 balls total.</li>
<li>In a large pot, heat the vegetable oil over medium-high heat until the temperature reaches 350°F (180°C).</li>
<li>Working in batches, fry the shrimp balls in the hot oil for 5-6 minutes, or until the internal temperature reaches 145°F (63°C).</li>
<li>Serve immediately with sweet chili sauce alongside for dipping.</li>
<li>Enjoy!</li>
