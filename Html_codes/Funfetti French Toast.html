<p><b>FRENCH TOAST</p></b>
<li>2 ½ cups whole milk(600 mL)</li>
<li>4 large eggs</li>
<li>2 large egg yolks</li>
<li>2 teaspoons McCormick® vanilla extract</li>
<li>6 tablespoons unsalted butter, divided</li>
<li>rainbow sprinkle, for garnish</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Preparation</b></p>
<ol>
<li>Make the brioche: Grease an 8 x 4-inch loaf pan with nonstick spray.</li>
<li>In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook attachment, combine the warm milk, yeast, sugar, and 1 cup of flour. Mix on low speed until fully combined. Cover the mixture with a clean kitchen towel and let rest for 20 minutes, or until the mixture is frothy.</li>
<li>In a large spouted measuring cup or medium bowl, whisk together the eggs, vanilla, and melted butter.</li>
<li>Uncover the flour mixture and return to the stand mixer. With the mixer running on low speed, slowly pour in the egg mixture. Once incorporated, gradually add the remaining 3 cups of flour and the salt, stopping to scrape down the sides of the bowl between additions. Continue mixing until the dough becomes very smooth and elastic and begins to pull away from the sides of the bowl cleanly, about 10 minutes. Cover the bowl with a kitchen towel and let rise in a warm place for about 45 minutes, or until doubled in size.</li>
<li>Add ½ cup rainbow nonpareils to the dough and mix with a rubber spatula to incorporate.</li>
<li>Cover the dough again and refrigerate for 30 minutes, or until visibly puffed.</li>
<li>Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and divide into 8 equal pieces. Roll each piece into a ball and place in the prepared pan, 2 by 4. Cover with the kitchen towel and let proof until doubled in size, about 30 minutes.</li>
<li>Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C).</li>
<li>In a small bowl, whisk together the egg yolk and heavy cream.</li>
<li>Brush the dough with egg wash, then cover with the remaining 2 tablespoons rainbow nonpareils and the rainbow sprinkles.</li>
<li>Bake the brioche for 35–38 minutes, or until deep golden brown and the loaf sounds hollow inside when tapped. The internal temperature should reach 190°F (88°C). Allow the loaf to cool in the pan for 10 minutes, then remove and let cool completely on a wire rack.</li>
<li>Meanwhile, make the frosting: In a medium bowl, whisk together the powdered sugar and milk until smooth.</li>
<li>Make the French toast: In a large, shallow dish, whisk together the milk, eggs, egg yolks, and vanilla.</li>
<li>Slice the brioche evenly into 8 pieces, each about 1-inch-thick.</li>
<li>Melt 2 tablespoons of butter in a large nonstick or cast-iron skillet over medium heat.</li>
<li>Dip 1–2 slices of brioche at a time in the egg mixture, flipping to coat on both sides, then add to the skillet in a single layer and cook until golden on bottom, about 3 minutes. Flip and cook until golden on the other side, about 3 minutes more. Repeat with the remaining slices of brioche, adding the remaining butter as needed.</li>
<li>Top the French toast with the frosting and rainbow sprinkles.</li>
<li>Enjoy!</li>
