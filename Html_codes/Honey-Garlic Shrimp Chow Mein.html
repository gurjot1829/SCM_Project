<p><b>Preparation</b></p>
<ol>
<li>In a 2-cup (480ml) liquid measuring cup, combine the ginger, garlic, soy sauce, and honey.</li>
<li>Pour about ⅓ cup (80 ml) of sauce over the shrimp in a medium bowl and toss to coat. Reserve the rest of the sauce. Cover the shrimp with plastic wrap and marinate in the refrigerator for 30 minutes to 1 hour.</li>
<li>In a wok or deep skillet over medium-high heat, heat 2 tablespoons of cooking oil, then add the par-cooked noodles. Cook for 1-2 minutes, allowing the noodles to crisp, then flip and cook for another 1-2 minutes. Transfer to a plate and set aside.</li>
<li>In the same wok, heat 1 tablespoon of cooking oil, then add the onion, broccoli, carrots, and ⅓ cup (80 ml) of the sauce. Cook for 2-3 minutes, or until the onions are translucent.</li>
<li>Add the cabbage and season with salt and pepper to taste. Cook for 2 minutes more, or until the vegetables have softened.</li>
<li>Push the vegetables to one side of the wok and add the remaining cooking oil to the empty side, followed by the marinated shrimp. Cook for 1 minute without disturbing, then flip the shrimp over and cook for another 2 minutes, until the shrimp are pink and their tails have curled in.</li>
<li>Mix the cooked shrimp with the vegetables and add the crispy chow mein noodles and the remaining sauce. Toss gently and cook for another 2-3 minutes, or until everything is well combined. Garnish with sliced scallions.</li>
<li>Enjoy!</li>
