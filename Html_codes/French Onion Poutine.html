<p><b>Ingredients for</b><br>4 servings<p>
<ul>
<li>6 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
<li>1 large yellow onion, sliced into ¼-inch-thick half moons</li>
<li>1 teaspoon McCormick® Dried Thyme Leaves, plus more for garnish</li>
<li>1 ½ cups beef stock(360 mL)</li>
<li>.87 oz McCormick® Brown Gravy(10 g)</li>
<li>32 oz frozen crinkle fries(945 g), cooked according to package instructions</li>
<li>1 cup shredded gruyère cheese(100 g)</li>
<li>¾ cup cheese curds(175 g)</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Preparation</b></p>
<ol>
<li>Melt the butter in a 12-inch cast iron skillet over medium-low heat. Add the onion and sprinkle with the McCormick® Dried Thyme Leaves. Cook, stirring and flipping the onions occasionally, until caramelized, 30–35 minutes. Remove about ⅓ cup of the onions from the pan and set aside.</li>
<li>Pour the beef stock into the pan with the remaining onions, sprinkle in the McCormick® Brown Gravy, and whisk until smooth. Bring to a gentle simmer and cook, whisking constantly, until the gravy thickens, 2–3 minutes. Remove about half of the gravy from the pan and set aside.</li>
<li>Layer half the fries on top of the remaining gravy in the pan, then top with half of the Gruyère and cheese curds. Repeat layering with the other half of the fries, remaining Gruyère and cheese curds, and reserved caramelized onions, then pour the rest of the gravy on top.</li>
<li>turn the broiler on high. Place the pan under the broiler for about 5 minutes, or until the cheese has melted and is golden brown.</li>
<li>Garnish the poutine with more McCormick® Dried Thyme Leaves and serve warm.</li>
<li>Enjoy!</li>
