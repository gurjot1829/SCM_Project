<h2>Donuts</h2>
<p>Making donuts and munchkins from scratch can seem like an intimidating endeavor, but once you go homemade, it's really hard to go back to store-bought. After you make the dough and let it rise overnight, you'll cut the donut and donut hole shapes and fry them in a heavy pan. While they rest, whisk together the glaze and either drizzle over the donuts or dunk them in it. Add sprinkles if you want and enjoy your warm, fresh-baked treats â€” this recipe makes a lot of them!

<p><b>Ingredients for</b><br>12 servings<p>
<ul>
<li>1 1/2 cups milk</li>
<li>1 cup sugar</li>
<li>1/2 oz yeast</li>
<li>1 stick unsalted butter</li>
<li>3 eggs</li>
<li>1 tablespoon vanilla extract </li>
<li>5 cups flour</li>
<li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil </li>
</ul>
<p><b>Preparation</b></p>
<ol>
<li>In a medium bowl, add the milk, sugar, and yeast, stirring to combine.</li>
<li>In a separate medium bowl, add the butter, eggs, and vanilla extract, stirring to combine.</li>
<li>Add the milk mixture to the egg mixture and whisk to combine. Transfer to a large bowl and add the flour in thirds, stirring between each addition.</li>
<li>Dump the dough onto a lightly floured surface and knead for 5 minutes, until smooth. Gently poke the dough with a finger--the dough should bounce back up from the indentation.</li>
<li>Place the dough in a large bowl, and lightly coat the dough with oil. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap.</li>
<li>Let the dough rise in a warm place for an hour, or until doubled in size.</li>
<li>Take the dough out and knead on a floured surface for 5 minutes until smooth. Place the dough in an oiled bowl and repeat with rise overnight in refrigerator.</li>
<li>Roll out the dough on a floured surface until 1/4 inch (6 mm) thick.</li>
<li>Cut out the doughnuts and donut holes with a cookie cutter and piping tip.</li>
<li>Melt enough shortening over medium heat to come up just 2 inches (5 cm) up on the side of a heavy frying pan. Heat the shortening to 375F (190C)</li>
<li>Fry the donuts and donut holes for 45 seconds on each side, or until golden brown.</li>
<li>In a bowl, combine the powdered sugar, dry milk powder, vanilla extract and hot water until smooth.</li>
<li>Strain the glaze through a fine-mesh sieve to remove any lumps.</li>
<li>Dunk the donuts in the glaze or drizzle the glaze on top.</li>
<li>Enjoy!</li>
