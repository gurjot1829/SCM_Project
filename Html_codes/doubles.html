<p><b>Preparation</b></p>
<ol>
<li>In a medium bowl , add flour, salt, yeast, turmeric, and sugar.</li>
<liSlowly add in warm water and mix to form a soft, mildly sticky dough. Rub the dough with olive oil and knead for about a minute. Allow the dough to rest for at least 2 hours. Then, divide the dough into 14 balls. Allow to rest for another hour.li>
<li>Put oil on a flat surface, oil your hands as well. Place the dough on the oiled surface, and form the dough into a 4-5 inches circle.</li>
<li>Heat oil in a medium pot. On medium high heat, add in the dough and cook until golden brown. If the oil is hot enough this will take only a few seconds. Place the cooked dough, or bara, on a plate with a paper towel to soak up excess oil. Set aside.</li>
<li>To make the channa, first add oil to a medium-sized pot. Add in onions, and thyme. Cook until onions are translucent.</li>
<li>Add in all the dry spices. Cook for another few minutes. Then, add in cooked chickpeas, green onions, and scotch Bonnet. Cook for another 5-10 minutes. Add in chopped cilantro.</li>
<li>Add in 1 cup (240 ml) of water, bringing the water to a boil. Allow the mixture to reduce to half, stirring constantly.</li>
<li>Serve warm.</li>
<li>Enjoy!</li>
