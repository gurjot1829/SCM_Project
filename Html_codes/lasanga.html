<p><b>Ingredients for</b><br>6 servings<p>
<ul>
<li>cooking spray</li>
<li>1 lb ground beef</li>
<li>4 cups marinara sauce</li>
<li>4 cups whole milk ricotta</li>
<li>2 cups grated Parmesan cheese </li>
<li>2 tablespoons fresh parsley </li>
<li>2 tablespoons fresh basil</li>
<li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
<li>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
<li>2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil</li>
<li>15 lasagna noodles</li>
<li>3 cups shredded mozzarella cheese </li>
</ul>
<p><b>Preparation</b></p>
<ol>
<li>Preheat the oven to 350F (180C). Grease a 9 x 13-inch (22 x 33 cm) baking dish lightly with nonstick spray.</li>
<li>In a large bowl, mix together the ground beef and marinara sauce.</li>
<li>In a separate large bowl, combine the ricotta, Parmesan, parsley, basil, salt, pepper, and olive oil.</li>
<li>Spread 1 cup of the meat sauce over the bottom of the prepared baking dish. Top with 5 cooked lasagna noodles, overlapping as needed to completely cover the sauce. Spread 2 cups of the ricotta mixture over the noodles. Top with 1 cup of mozzarella cheese. Repeat with the remaining meat sauce, noodles, ricotta, and mozzarella to make 2 more layers.</li>
<li>Bake the lasagna for 25-30 minutes, until the cheese is melted and the sauce is bubbling up through the layers. Turn the broiler to high and broil for 1-2 minutes, until the top layer of cheese is bubbly and golden brown.</li>
<li>Let the lasagna cool for 30-45 minutes, then serve.</li>
<li>Enjoy!</li>
