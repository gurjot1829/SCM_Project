<p><b>Ingredients for</b><br>2 servings<p>
<ul>
<li>2 cups all-purpose flour(250 g)</li>
<li>3 eggs</li>
<li>¼ cup butter(55 g), melted</li>
<li>3 tablespoons granulated sugar</li>
<li>3 cups milk(720 mL)</li>
<li>½ cup hazelnut spread(115 g)</li>
<li>10 strawberries, sliced</li>
<li>powdered sugar, to garnish</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Preparation</b></p>
<ol>
<li>In a large bowl, combine flour, eggs, butter, and sugar, stirring until ingredients are slightly mixed.</li>
<li>Add the milk ½ cup (120 ml) at a time, stirring vigorously, making sure the milk is completely incorporated into the batter and that the batter is smooth before adding more milk.</li>
<li>Repeat with the rest of the milk. The batter should be very liquidy and have no lumps.</li>
<li>In a pan over medium heat, pour ⅓ cup (95 grams) of the batter in the center and swirl the batter around the edges of the pan until set.</li>
<li>To know when the crepe is ready to flip, lift up one of the edges about ⅓ of the way. The bottom side should be golden brown. Flip the crepe.</li>
<li>Cook until the edges are starting to slightly crisp.</li>
<li>Remove from heat and cover with a paper towel to make sure the crepes stay moist.</li>
<li>Spread half of the chocolate hazelnut spread on half of the crepe.</li>
<li>Lay half of the strawberries on the chocolate spread.</li>
<li>Fold the other half of the crepe on top of the strawberries, then fold the crepe in half.</li>
<li>Repeat with the other crepe.</li>
<li>Enjoy!</li>
