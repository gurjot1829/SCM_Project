<li>1 cup light brown sugar(200 g), packed</li>
<li>½ cup granulated sugar(100 g)</li>
<li>3 large eggs, room temperature</li>
<li>1 cup vegetable oil(240 mL)</li>
<li>1 cup raisin(150 g)</li>
<li>1 cup crushed pineapple(225 g), canned</li>
<p><b>ICING</p></b>
<li>1 cup unsalted butter(225 g), (2 sticks) room temperature</li>
<li>12 oz cream cheese(340 g), room temperature</li>
<li>1 ½ teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
<li>2 cups powdered sugar(240 g)</li>
<li>2 cups walnuts(200 g), crushed</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Preparation</b></p>
<ol>
<li>Preheat the oven to 350˚F (180˚C). Grease 3 8-inch (20 cm) round cake pans and line with parchment paper.</li>
<li>Grate the carrots on the small holes of a box grater. Set aside.</li>
<li>In a large bowl, sift together 2½ cups (310 G) of flour, the cinnamon, allspice, salt, baking powder, and baking soda. Whisk together.</li>
<li>In a separate large bowl, beat the brown sugar, granulated sugar, and eggs together with an electric hand mixer on medium speed until just combined.</li>
<li>With the mixer running, gradually pour in the vegetable oil.</li>
<li>With the mixer on medium-low speed, add ⅓ of the flour mixture at a time to the wet ingredients. Beat just to incorporate. Stop mixing when there is just a small amount of flour visible.</li>
<li>In a small bowl, toss the raisins with the remaining tablespoon of flour.</li>
<li>Add the raisin, grated carrots, and pineapple to the batter and fold to incorporate with a rubber spatula.</li>
<li>Divide the cake batter evenly between the prepared pans and smooth the tops.</li>
<li>Bake for 25-30 minutes, until a fork inserted in the center of a cake comes out clean.</li>
<li>Cool the cakes on a wire rack until the pans are cool to the touch. Remove the cakes from the pans and let cool completely on the rack.</li>
<li>Make the icing: In a large bowl, beat together the butter, cream cheese, and vanilla with an electric hand mixer on medium-low speed. Once combined, mix on medium-high speed for 30 seconds, until light and fluffy.</li>
<li>Add the powdered sugar, ½ cup (60 G) at a time, beating on medium-low speed to incorporate each addition.</li>
<li>Assemble the cake: Check to see if the top of each cake is flat. If not, use a serrated knife level off the cakes.</li>
<li>Place 1 cake layer on a serving platter or cake stand. Spoon ¼ of the icing on top and spread in an even layer. Add another layer of cake and spread with another ¼ of the icing. Set the last cake layer on top with the bottom up to ensure a very flat surface. Spread the rest of the icing over the top and sides.</li>
<li>Gently press the walnuts into the icing around the sides of the cake.</li>
<li>Chill for 30-60 minutes to let the icing set, then slice and serve.</li>
<li>Enjoy!</li>
