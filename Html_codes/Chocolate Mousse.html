<h2>Chocolate Mousse</h2>
<p>You don’t need to go to a pricey restaurant or work really hard to make your own chocolate mousse. This four-ingredient recipe involves beating heavy cream and sugar with an electric mixer, stirring your favorite dark or milk chocolate and hot cream, and then folding the two mixes together. Fancy it up by putting the mousse in chilled martini glasses and topping with whatever you want — whipped cream, fresh raspberries, pirouette cookies, or chocolate shavings.
