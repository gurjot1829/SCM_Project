<h2>Chaklis</h2>
<p>In celebration of Diwali, the festival of lights, we’re making chaklis–crispy, savory, Indian snacks that incorporate a fragrant blend of spices. Chaklis are a great addition to your Diwali spread to balance a table of sweets, or just to enjoy with a cup of chai.

<p><b>Ingredients for</b><br>4 servings<p>
<ul>
<li>1 cup rice flour(125 g), toasted</li>
<li>½ cup toasted gram flour(65 g)</li>
<li>1 teaspoon whole cumin seeds</li>
<li>2 tablespoons white sesame seeds</li>
<li>2 teaspoons red chili powder</li>
<li>½ teaspoon ajwain</li>
<li>½ teaspoon asafoetida</li>
<li>1 ½ teaspoons kosher salt</li>
<li>¼ cup water(60 mL), plus more as needed</li>
<li>¼ cup ghee(55 g), or clarified butter</li>
<li>safflower oil, for frying</li>
<p><b>SPECIAL EQUIPMENT</p></b>
<li>chakli maker</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Preparation</b></p>
<ol>
<li>Cut out 12–15 4-inch (10 cm) squares of parchment paper and set aside.</li>
<li>In a large bowl, whisk together the rice flour, gram flour, cumin seeds, sesame seeds, red chile powder, turmeric, ajwain, asafoetida, and salt.</li>
<li>Add the water to a small pot and bring to a boil over high heat, then add the ghee and let melt. Remove the pot from the heat.</li>
<li>Create a well in the center of the dry ingredients with your hand. Stream the ghee mixture into the dry ingredients and stir to combine well, then use your hands to knead into a firm dough. If the dough is too dry or stiff, add more hot water, a couple tablespoons at a time.</li>
<li>Cover the bowl with a plate and let the dough rest for 30 minutes.</li>
<li>Add 3 inches (7.5 cm) of safflower oil to a large, high-walled skillet and heat to 375°F (190°C) over medium-high heat.</li>
<li>While the oil heats, pipe the chakli: Prepare the chakli maker by lightly greasing the inside with safflower oil. Load the chakli maker with some of the dough. Tighten the lid, then pipe the chaklis in circular shapes onto the prepared squares of parchment paper.</li>
<li>Carefully slide 2–4 chaklis at a time into the hot oil and fry until golden brown, 3–5 minutes. Remove from the oil and drain on a paper towel-lined plate while you fry the remaining chaklis.</li>
<li>Enjoy!</li>
